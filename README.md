# Flex Image Gallery Project
This project is a simple image gallery that uses CSS Flexbox to display images and text. When a panel is clicked, it opens up to display more information about the panel.

# Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

# Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
That's it! You should now be able to interact with the image gallery.

# Usage
To use the image gallery, simply click on one of the panels. The panel will expand to show more information about the panel. To collapse the panel, click on it again.

# Styling
The image gallery is styled using CSS. The styles.css file contains all of the CSS for the project. The CSS uses Flexbox to layout the panels.

# JavaScript
The index.js file contains the JavaScript for the project. It uses the querySelectorAll() function to select all of the panels and adds event listeners to each panel. When a panel is clicked, the toggleOpen() function is called, which toggles the open class on the panel. When the panel finishes transitioning, the toggleActive() function is called, which toggles the open-active class on the panel.
